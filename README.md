Project Title: Simple Node.js Web Server

Description:

This project is a straightforward implementation of a web server built using Node.js. It serves HTML pages to clients, making it a great starting point for learning about web server development and how to handle HTTP requests. The server is designed to be easy to set up and use, making it an ideal choice for beginners and those who want a basic foundation in web server development.

Key Features:

    Basic File Serving: The web server can serve HTML pages stored in its directory to clients, allowing you to create a basic website structure.
